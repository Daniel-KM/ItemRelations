Omeka Plugin: ItemRelations
====================

Allows administrators to define relations between items.

This fork is to try to add ItemRelations to the API - at this stage it's a weekend project only.

So far these might work:

/api/item\_relations #List all ItemRelationsRelations

/api/item\_relations/1 #Get ItemRelationsRelations with id = 1
